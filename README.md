# Summarization-of-Customer-reviews

## Problem Statement

Here we will see how the entire context of a particular text can be automatically generated in a precise less number of words. I have used the kaggle data set (https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews/home) for this case. I have used RNN (LSTM ENCODER - DECODER) structure to generate the summaries of the reviews. All the work is done in Jupyter notebook, conda environment; python 3.7 with keras in backend. The purpose of this project is to learn how RNN (LSTM) SeqtoSeq model works and this type of problem can be extrapolated to many other problems let it be document summarization in finance, healthcare.
