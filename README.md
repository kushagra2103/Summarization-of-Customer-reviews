# Summarization-of-Customer-reviews

## Problem Statement

Here we will see how the entire context of a particular text can be automatically generated in a precise less number of words. I have used the kaggle data set (https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews/home) for this case. I have used RNN (LSTM ENCODER - DECODER) structure to generate the summaries of the reviews. All the work is done in Jupyter notebook, conda environment; python 3.7 with keras in backend. The purpose of this project is to learn how RNN (LSTM) SeqtoSeq model works and this type of problem can be extrapolated to many other problems let it be document summarization in finance, healthcare.

## Theory Behind the Encoder-Decoder Sequential Model 

### LSTM Cell

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/91410373-71b0b080-e864-11ea-91ad-a78d92581f75.PNG)

Here 'h' represents the hidden state, 'c' represents the cell state, 't' represents the  current time stamp. 

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/91412893-010b9300-e868-11ea-9043-c39356a37e31.PNG)

The LSTM has three parts; forget gate, update gate and output gate. 

#### How the cell works ?

Gates are a way to optionally let information through. They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net layer and a pointwise multiplication operation. The sigmoid layer outputs numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component should be let through. A value of zero means “let nothing through,” while a value of one means “let everything through!”

##### Forget Gate 

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/91521094-8187cd80-e914-11ea-85ab-28c0521bda50.PNG)

This gate is primarly used for information that needs to be forget. If the context changes, for example if there is gender change (male to female) or from plural to singular or vice versa, the cell needs to remeber that context has changed. Forget gate plays a role by "not transferring" the male/ plural information to the cell state. It uses the sigmoid function which outputs 0 or 1. 0 means completely forget and 1 means retains the whole information. Wf is  a matrix which is combination of two weight s matrices for xt and ht-1. bf is the bias added. 

##### Update Gate 

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/91527106-b6028600-e922-11ea-804b-beb5253ee410.PNG)

It has an input layer that decides what values we need to update (like from male to female/ plural to singular). So it is passed again to a neural layer network same as forget layer which ouputs 0/1 and then is multiplied by cell state c~ which will keep the new information and stored in the cell state. Now the previous cell state ct-1 and this current updated c~ are added which will form the current cell state ct which will again passed as ct-1 for the next time step.

##### Output Gate 

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/91530085-19db7d80-e928-11ea-98ab-ec53415439c7.PNG)

Now to decide what goes to output, a output sigmoid function is again defined same as forget gate. It is responsible to pass the information that a context has changed and it might output the information relevant to the "new" context. So multiplied by tanh(ct) and is output as ht. For final output, a dense layer is applied to each time step/ last time step depending upon whether it is many to many / many to one structure.  


### Encoder-Decoder Sequential Model 

![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/91533315-5067c700-e92d-11ea-83e8-c2aeafa04026.png)

#### Summary of the above model 

1. Both the encoder and decoder have LSTM cells as units

2. Encoder reads the input text in form of time steps, embedding layer converts it into the word embeddings and all the information in defined number of time steps are passed as initial vectors for decoder; c(cell state) and h (hidden state)

3. Decoder model then predicts the outputs at every time step , where the output at previous time step is feed as an input to the next time step to predict the next output.

4. Output at every time step from decoder model is then combined and the resultant summary is formed


## Text Cleaning and Preprocessing 

Before the data is split into training and testing, our data contains a lot of noise which are needed to remove in order for our model to predict better.

1. Missing data 

There are some missing data in both Review Text and Title, they needed to be removed, I have used "dropna" function which basically removes all the rows which has atleast one missing data 

2. Noise 

There are noise in form of special characters, capital/small letters, punctuations, numbers, short forms like in place of 'is not' it is 'isn't', one letter words, stop_words etc which are needed to be removed in order to improve the quality of the data our model will feed upon.

here the text is cleaned part.

3. Defining the fix length for input to encoder and output for decoder; in short defining the time steps for encoder and decoder. Seeing the histograms, we can fix the input time steps to be 50 and for output to be 7. It means each example will have max length of 50, if length is < 50, it will be "post paded" and if length > 50 then it will be truncated, same for output. So summary will have max length of 7, it can be< 7 also.

4. Tokenization and Padding

Tokenize the text and summary part respectively by importing tokenizer from keras.preprocessing.text. It is done because the model only understands the numbers. So tokenizer will create a vocabulary of all the unique words present in the text and summary corpus and will make a word-index pair. Here I have choosen vocabulary length for text part to be 5000 and for summary part 3000. The numbers represent the top words by frequency present in the respective corpus. You can have a choice of including all the unique words by getting the value of len(x_tokenizer.word_index) + 1; here x_tokenizer is created by training it on training 'text' data, same goes for 'summary' data as well. Post padding is done to make the input and output of fix size (50 and 7 respectively). 


## Model Development 

![14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/91577917-0f8ca400-e967-11ea-87bb-926594fa3a4d.png)

#### How the model works ?

In the above pic, u1, u2 .... uT represents the inputs given to the model with T= 50 in our case. c represents the cell state, h represents the hidden state. co is initialised to zero. Now there is a embedding layer before the input goes to LSTM units. We have choosen the number of our dimensions to be 100. So each word will be a 100 dimesion vector. After that, from the embedding layer, it goes to LSTM unit where it is combined with forget gate, update gate, input gate and output gate as explained above in LSTM section. Now each of the (Wf,bf), (Wo,bo), (Wu,bu) and (Wi,bi) are the matrices that will be same for each time step, W is the weight matrix and b is the bias for neural structure. cT and hT are then passed as initial states to decoder network. Decoder part behaves different in training and inference phase 

Training Phase: Here the actual output is fed at each time step to make it learn faster. Then error is backpropogated through back in time. 

Inference Phase: Here the actual output from the previous time step is fed as inuput for next time step in the decoder model. We are taking the word with maximum probability (greedy algorithm).

"Start" token is given as initial input for the decoder model to start producing the output both in the training and inference phase. Output from the LSTM layer is then passed to first a Time Distriuted Dense layer (tanh) and then again to Time Distriuted Dense layer (softmax). Time distributed layer applies the same activation function at every time step. Dense function is applied to make the output in the desired vector. In our case we have applied 2 dense layers. So hidden state from each LSTM unit in decoder model is passed through first a dense layer of tanh (300 neuron layer) and then a softmax layer (y_vocab=3001; number of neurons to predict each word in in the vocab with their probablities). Then the word with maximum probablity is taken as the output for that time step. 

#### Structure of the model and number of parameters calculation

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/91614753-bd1ba980-e99f-11ea-9dbc-d0b0085bb355.PNG)

##### Encoder Part

Embedding layer 

It is the word embedding layer that takes the input of 50 (Step size) words as one example. It outputs in form of (word vocab length, no. of dimensions) (5001, 100). So it a weight matrix with number of weights to be trained equals to 5001* 100 = 500100. 

LSTM Layer

Output from the embedding layer goes to LSTM layer. We have four gates. Lets calculate parameters for one gate. For forget gate, it has two inputs, one from previous hidden state and one from the embedding layer. The Wf weight matrix for the forget gate and bias are the parameters that are needed to be trained. Weight matrix consists of two matrices, one for the hidden state (shape =(,,300)) and the one for the input matrice (shape=(,,100)) and will be interacting with the 300 neurons NN. Also we will be adding the bias parameter for every neuron (300). Total trainable parameters for forget gate is 300 * 300 + 300 * 100 + 300 = 120300. There are four gates, so total parameters for an LSTM unit in encoder is 4 * 120300 = 481200

Output from the last LSTM unit (last time step) is then passed as the initial state to the decoder part as c'0

##### Decoder Part 

Embedding layer 

It is the word embedding layer that takes the input (output from the previous time step). It outputs in form of (word vocab length, no. of dimensions) (3001, 100). So it a weight matrix with number of weights to be trained equals to 3001 * 100 = 500100. Here the step size (T') maximum is 7. So if the previous output token is "end", then it will stop producing the output

LSTM Layer

Same as the one in the encoding layer. 

Time Distributed Dense Layer 1

Here the activation function used is tanh. It is a 300 NN structure. Output from the LSTM layer is at every time step is fed to thsi dense layer. It output is in the shape of (batch size, time steps, 300). Trainable parameters are weights matrices and the bias added for each neuron; 300 * (300 + 1) = 90300

Time Distributed Dense Layer 2 

Here the activation function used is tanh. It is a y_vocab (3001) NN structure. Output from the LSTM layer is at every time step is fed as an input to the next time step input. It's output is in the shape of (batch size, time steps, y_vocab). Trainable parameters are weights matrices and the bias added for each neuron; 3001 * (300 + 1) = 903301 . Here the ouput is the word in the y_vocab with the maximum probability (greedy search)

Total Trainable Parameters = 2756201

##### A little on the input shape to LSTM layer

for Encoder Model 

Batch size = 32

Time Steps = 50 

Seq_len = 100 ; each word embedding lenght 

For Decoder model 

Training Phase 

Batch Size = 32

Time Steps = 7

Seq_len = 100; each word embedding dimension 


## Training and Results 

Data is split into 90/10 % ratio. RMS prop is taken as an optimizer. Epochs is et to 50. Patience is set to 2 (means if val_loss is not decreased after 2 epochs training will stop). Batch size is taken as 32
