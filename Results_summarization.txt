Review: I bought this top in my usual size large based on other reviews and it fit perfectly.   i have long arms and the sleeves are the perfect length.  the fabric is a slightly stretchy jacquard and very nice quality.   the top is definitely more fitted with a significant amount of fabric at the peplum portion.   i wish that this was a bit less, which is why i only gave it 4 stars.  otherwise, it's a great top for fall that can be dressed up with a pencil skit or more casually with jeans.  definitely 

Actual summary: nice quality peplum top for fall
Predicted summary: great top


Review: I was excited to see these on sale in the honey color i wanted. unfortunately, they were really more of a yellow than the golden color in the photo. also, they were so baggy in the rear that i looked silly, which was surprising since i don't have a small behind. unfortunately all the smaller sizes were sold out. had to send them back. 

Actual summary: not really honey
Predicted summary: not for me


Review: This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work. 

Actual summary: cute cardigan, fun piece

Review: I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it, and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter, but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes, definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!

Review: Usually i am a huge meadow rue fan, but not this time. the print is okay, but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft. if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt, but since it was neither it was returned? 

Actual summary: close, but not quite...
Predicted summary: not for me


Review: I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered, it was comical. so so boxy. literally, shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person, it may look super cute!
just didn't work on my slim build. :( 

Actual summary: so cute but way too boxy

Review: I bought this in both the taupe and ivory. the beading on the neck line, the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt. i bought a size 2 which is normally what i wear at retailer, so i would say it is true to size. i really like the length of the top. it hits mid-hip on me. it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline. i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it. i bought it to

Review: These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos, but these are far more versatile. i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens, but the stet chino can be dressed up or down. they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful. i'm 5'8" 138 lbs, and i took my usual size 28 in these. i have full thighs, and i didn't find these to be too tight in the legs at all, but i only tried on the black/charcoal.

Review: I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i'm slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute, casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it.

Review: Hi ladies,
does this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time? yes. did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls? yes. however, i am a large chested girl 34d, i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best, most comfortable, amazing, non hurting/poking best strapless bra i have ever owned. i just bought three more, just in case the first two wear out. i love this, i love how far it comes down on the sides, i love that it doesn't slip do 

Actual summary: best strapless ever

Review: This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose, and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4, 32dd, waist 27 and 130 lbs.
